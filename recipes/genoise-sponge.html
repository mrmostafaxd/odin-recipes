        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 large egg whites</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon cream of tartar</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
            <li>2 cups sifted cake flour</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a
                10-inch cake pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat egg whites and cream of tartar until soft peaks form. Add
                3/4 cup sugar gradually, beating until very stiff.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cream butter and 1 cup sugar in a large bowl with an electric
                beater until light in color. Add egg yolks, and beat until thick
                and fluffy. Sift flour, baking powder, and salt over batter;
                fold in. Gently fold in egg whites. Pour batter into prepared
                pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the
                center comes out clean, about 50 to 60 minutes. Cool in the pans
                for 10 minutes, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
            </li>
